1. Answer the programming questions and submit your solutions on this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LbXG1TfjSy9jUOsLJv1mVqhPBS1XO0wECcP9cO1K5kY/viewform).
2. You have 90 minutes time. Solve questions 1 and 2 first. Then the rest.

4. The earlier you solve the more points you get.
5. There are infinite ways to solve these problems. If two people submit identical solutions, both of them will be rejected. 



## 1. Pyramid

Using HTML/CSS/JS create a page where the user can enter a number(height of a pyramid).
As soon as the user enters the number, draw a pyramid with those many stacks.

Eg. if the number is 10 , draw a pyramid with ten stacks.

![10 pyramid](/images/10%20stacks.png)

Eg. if the number is 100, draw a pyramid with 100 stacks.

![10 pyramid](/images/100%20stacks.png)

The width of the pyramid, should not exceed the width of the page(no vertical
scrolling).


## 2. Family Tree

Using, HTML and JS create a application to build a family tree.
The nodes are parent, child, grand child, great grand child, great great grand
child and so on.

When the user clicks on a node, a child for that node is added.

i.e When the user clicks on parent a child is added.

When the user clicks on child a grand child is added.

When the user clicks on great great great grand child a great great great great
grand child is added

## 3. Codebrahma

Write a function in javascript which takes in a integer.

If the Integer is divisible by 3 it prints "Code"

If the integer is divisible by 5 it prints "Brahma"

If the integer is divisible by 15 it prints "CodeBrahma"

If the integer is not divisible by any of these numbers it prints "VIT"

## 4. Tip less

In Mars, there are only two denominations of currency ,x and y. 
A Marsian goes to a bar and the bill is "z". Using x and y he has to pay the
bill. But the bar doesnt tender change, any extra money will be taken as tips.

So write a function in javascript that helps the marsian to reduce the tips.

The function takes in x, y, z and returns the amount of tip he has to pay.
