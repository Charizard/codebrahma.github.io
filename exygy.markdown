# Exygy - Codebrahma

We are a team who wants to write well-architectured, heavily tested code. And we cant live with
bad code. Ruby is the language we speak. And the ruby code we write reads like
english

## Code-Quality

***Well architectured codebases welcome change.***

Most of our clients are startups who are interating rapidly. Therefore change is very frequent. And we make sure that our codebases are well architectured so that they are flexbile enough to welcome change.

We obsesses even with the quality of things unseen. For us code-quality matters. 

We go beyond Lean Controllers Fat models. We make sure that our classes obey the Single responsiblity principle as much as possible. We take care to avoid data clumps, long methods and other code-smells. Inshort we keep track of the latest best practices of writing good code and follow it. We invest heavily in educating ourselves. 
We believe this is one of the areas we stand out. 

Code quality is subjective and we dont promise subjective goals. We promise
a [codeclimate](https://codeclimate.com/) score > 3.6/4

## Consistency

All our code is at least reviewed by one person before it goes into the master branch and more or less follows the [github style](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/code-review)

We take to the github style of writing [ruby code](https://github.com/styleguide/ruby), so that the code written by various members of the project all look the same.

## Test Driven Development

We are rigourous practioners of writing our tests first. Here are the reasons

1. ***Confidence***. Writing Tests makes us insanely confident about our code.
2. TDD forces you to write __good code__. Its impossible to test a 1000 line
   method, and hence you will start breaking it down. Design begins.
3. Your Tests are your __documentation__. We used to comment our code to document
   it. But as we did quick fixes these comments grew out of date. We had to
   maintain these comments now. Instead of writing comments, write tests. They
   serve as executable documentation. Rspec reads like english and it is the
   best way to document your code.
4. ***Jenkins***. Continous Delivery. Quick Feedback. All you need is to push
   the code to github. If your test suite passes jenkins automatically deploys
   to the staging server
5. __Smooth Handover__. When we deliver the code to clients' inhouse team,
   having a fully spec'd codebase removes the fear in the new developers. They
   dont have to worry if they will break anything. They can just make the
   changes and if the test suite passes, they are good to deploy.

We write both request specs and unit level specs. So if you want to know what
a particular class is doing just open up its spec file.

Here is the [video](https://vimeo.com/70322154) showing an example of a request spec.We show the integration specs which checks the sign up and sign in flow. These specs run on every commit and makes sure that the user sign up and sign in process is never broken.


## Communication

We believe in over communication. We maintain pivotal tracker and a staging server. So that the client is always aware of the current status of the project

We do daily skype stand calls to give status updates and clarify doubts regarding the
days work. So we make sure that the client knows that we are going in the right
direction

## Delivery on Time

We dont miss our deadlines. We have never missed our deadlines. 

## Open Source Contributions

We contribute to open source on saturdays... Here are our latest contributions

1. [Rails gem we built](https://github.com/Codebrahma/Ari-Fetch)
2. [My contribution to jekyll 1](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/pull/1215)
3. [My contribution to jekyll 2](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/pull/1271)
4. [Viveks contribution to diaspora](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/pull/4226)

## Team

Vivek has been my team lead for a year now. He is actively involved in the
project and takes care of the daily stand up calls (The diaspora contribution
and the ARI FETCH plugin is the code he wrote). He consults me for architectural decisions. Thats the way it usually
is. We do whatever is necessary for the project. 

## I will fly to meet you

I have a business visa to the US. I was there for the yC 2011 demo day. So if
you need me there, for any reason whatsoever i will fly down.

# Why we want to work with you

1. I love the way you gave us the requirements. It took me only 10 minutes to get
   all of it.
2. I love your honesty and transparency
3. I am looking for a partner in the US, who can source projects regularly for
   us. And i think you are a perfect match. Clients like Google, zendesk and
   your transparency lure me to work with you

# Why you should work with us

1. ***Zero Worry***. You dont need to manage us. You can give us the requirements
   and you can trust us to deliver the job on time and with quality. You can go
   ahead and build your business and we will deliver this job on time with
   excellent quality
2. ***Quality***. The quality of the code we write is something we pride on. It
   is very easy to maintain and read
3. ***100 % Money Back Offer***. Give us a chance to work with you, and if you
